## Requirements
- [Node.js + npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Leap Motion Controller + [SDK](https://developer.leapmotion.com/get-started/)
- Microphone
- Headphones _(for best performance, but not necessary)_
- [Spotify (Desktop/ Mobile/ Web)](https://www.spotify.com/us/download/)
- A Spotify Premium account - Spotify only allows playback control of Premium accounts. You can sign up for a [30 day free trial](https://www.spotify.com/premium/) if you want to test our app.
- Replace application credentials in `app.js` (described below)

### Using your own credentials: 
(*Adapted from [Spotify's Web Authentication Examples](https://github.com/spotify/web-api-auth-examples)*)

You will need to register your app and get your own credentials from the Spotify for Developers Dashboard.

To do so, go to [your Spotify for Developers Dashboard](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and create your application. For the examples, we registered these Redirect URIs:

* http://localhost:8888 (needed for the implicit grant flow)
* http://localhost:8888/callback

Once you have created your app, replace the `client_id`, `redirect_uri` and `client_secret` in `app.js` with the ones you get from My Applications.

## Installing and Running Gesturify
1. Connect the Leap Motion controller to your laptop and ensure that SDK has been installed by searching for the Leap Motion Visualizer on your personal computer. 
1. Navigate to the root of folder containing the Gesturify code.
2. Open a terminal and run `npm install`.
3. Run the app locally with `node app.js`.
