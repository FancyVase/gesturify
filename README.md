# Gesturify
MIT 6.835 Spring 2018 Final Project - [Hiram Moncivais](https://github.com/FancyVase) and [Maryam Archie](https://github.com/maryam-a)

## Overiew
Maximize productivity with gestures + speech + Spotify

## Requirements
- [Node.js + npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- A Spotify Premium account - Spotify only allows playback control of Premium accounts. You can sign up for a [30 day free trial](https://www.spotify.com/premium/) if you want to test our app here.

### Using your own credentials: 
(*Adapted from [Spotify's Web Authentication Examples](https://github.com/spotify/web-api-auth-examples)*)

You will need to register your app and get your own credentials from the Spotify for Developers Dashboard.

To do so, go to [your Spotify for Developers Dashboard](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and create your application. For the examples, we registered these Redirect URIs:

* http://localhost:8888 (needed for the implicit grant flow)
* http://localhost:8888/callback

Once you have created your app, replace the `client_id`, `redirect_uri` and `client_secret` in `app.js` with the ones you get from My Applications.

## Installation
1. Navigate to the root of folder containing the Gesturify code.
2. Open a terminal and run `npm install`.
3. Run the app locally with `node app.js`.
4. Navigate to `localhost:8888` in your preferred browser.
5. After logging in, open the Spotify app on any of your devices and click the `Devices Available` icon. Choose Gesturify from the `Connect to a device` pop up.
6. Now, you're ready to use the app.
